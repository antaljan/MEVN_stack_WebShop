                <p>
                I consider human dignity, the right to free choice, and a life without fear to be the most fundamental values.
                </p><p>
                I believe that changes, challenges, and crises can be experienced with minimal fear, anxiety, and stress.
                </p><p>
                That’s why I work to help my clients face their challenges with greater self-awareness, in a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment—minimizing their fears and dissolving their anxieties.
                </p><p>
                Because life and change are meant to be lived, not feared!
