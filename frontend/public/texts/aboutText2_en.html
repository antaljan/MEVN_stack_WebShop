1. After chemotherapy, kidney failure, thrombosis, mastectomy, anaphylactic shock, I started working with cancer patients on the recommendation of one of my doctors.

2. I taught/I teach coaches, engineers, university lecturers, and doctors at university, in courses, and trainings, how to reduce stress in their lives, improve their problem-solving skills, and increase their efficiency.

3. In addition to my work, I studied in two university majors and a course to regain my speaking skills.

4. I take on 3 grief groups a year. One is for cancer patients, the other is for career changers, and the third is for those who have lost a companion animal.

5. There were times when I didn't believe in myself, when I was more interested in the opinions of others, when I ruminate for days on a negative remark. Today I don't care about anyone's opinion at all, I know that I have so much strength that I can do anything/achieve whatever I want, because I learned to become the main character of my own life, because it's my journey, my life and no one else's.

6. I love camping, I enjoy reconnecting with nature. It doesn't matter if I sleep in a tent, a car, a camper. In a month, my husband and our dogüòç built a camper out of a bus, with basic tools in a parking lot. Since then, we've been traveling around Europe with it (whenever possible). We're now at the Baltic Sea, so it's possible that the beach is a moving/real background image in one of my online trainings.

7. Due to some atrophied muscles, daily sports are not a matter of choice for me. I exercise at least 1-2 hours every day. I may not read a recommended book, I may do less in other areas, but sports cannot be left out.
