I’ve survived chemotherapy, kidney failure, thrombosis, a mastectomy, and even an anaphylactic shock. One of my doctors encouraged me to start working with cancer patients — and from that moment on, I knew I had something valuable to offer: compassion, lived experience, and an understanding of what truly matters.

I teach coaches, engineers, university lecturers, and medical professionals how to reduce stress, improve problem-solving skills, and increase efficiency — through university courses, training programs, and workshops.

At one point, I was studying in two university programs and taking an additional course simultaneously — all just to reclaim my ability to speak. Today, I don't just speak — I teach.

Each year, I lead three grief support groups:

One for cancer patients

One for career changers

And one for those grieving the loss of a companion animal

There was a time I didn’t believe in myself. I cared too much about what others thought. A single negative remark could haunt me for days. Now, I no longer worry about anyone’s opinion. I know the strength that lives in me — and I know I can do, build, or become anything I truly want. I’ve learned how to become the main character in my own life, because this is my path, my story, no one else’s.

I love camping — the way it reconnects me with nature brings me peace. It doesn’t matter if I sleep in a tent, a car, or a camper van. My husband, our dog 😍, and I built our own camper van from a bus in one month, using basic tools, in a parking lot. Since then, we’ve been traveling through Europe whenever we can. Right now, we're at the Baltic Sea, so yes — sometimes my virtual training sessions come with a real beach in the background!

Due to a few atrophied muscles, daily exercise isn’t just a choice for me — it’s a necessity. I move every single day for at least 1–2 hours. I might skip a book recommendation or delegate a few tasks — but movement is non-negotiable.
