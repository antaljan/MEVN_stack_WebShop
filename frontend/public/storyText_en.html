        <p>
        Why are so many people afraid of change? Why do so many strive to meet others’ expectations? What causes all this stress? And how can we reduce it?

        These questions emerged in me while I was fighting for my life during treatment for a cancer diagnosis.

        Today, as a psychologist, coach, lifestyle consultant, and therapist, I help others redefine their lives, overcome challenges, and reach their goals.
        </p><p>
        All of this takes place in a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment—at my clients’ own pace, without pressure, with full attention and within stable boundaries.
