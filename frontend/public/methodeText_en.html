        My work is based on three core pillars:
        </p>
        <p>  1. A safe, supportive, and stable environment – I pay special attention to ensuring that the work takes place within secure boundaries.</p>
        <p>  2. We move at my clients’ own pace, because I know that we are all different. That’s why I don’t rush, push, or pressure anyone.</p>
        <p>  3. Thinking together – there are no one-size-fits-all solutions here. Throughout the process, I walk alongside those who turn to me.
            Since each person experiences their situation differently, the outcome and the path to resolution are also unique.</p>
        <p>These three factors provide a framework in which we can bring out the best from my clients’ situations together.</p>
